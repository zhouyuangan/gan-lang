# gan-lang
This is a research and study project for learning how to write an Interpreter which can excute a program language named *gan*.

## build interpreter

```shell
sh build_interp.sh
```

and execute `hello.c` in examples folder.

```shell
./gan ../examples/hello.c
>>>
fibonacci( 0) = 1
fibonacci( 1) = 1
fibonacci( 2) = 2
fibonacci( 3) = 3
fibonacci( 4) = 5
fibonacci( 5) = 8
fibonacci( 6) = 13
fibonacci( 7) = 21
fibonacci( 8) = 34
fibonacci( 9) = 55
fibonacci(10) = 89
exit(0)
```
